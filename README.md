# Eternity
 - colour highlighting on selected file or folder.
 - to use files, nano must be installed.
 - libncurses development libraries must also be installed to make
 - tested in vs code terminal and is not flashing, flashes in os packaged terminal for some reason, until eternity runs nano once
	- shouldn't flash now, use erase() instead of clear();
 - copy and paste function
 - copying folder directly into same folder's working directory will make folder in folder to be copied
 - can move and rename folders with mv
 - clipboard can be cleared
